Understanding why is it difficult for us to understand non-duality

Because on the surface it sounds ridiculous, and the mind itself thinks in contrasts, or opposing forces: good and bad, light and darkness, pain and pleasure, life and death. These are all continuums that we use to judge each thing, person and experience in life. Nondualism aims to remove our judgement about this things, and to see the entire universe as a unified field. To the human mind this is nonsense, because the mind's function is to judge, divide, analyze where something is on any one of a myriad of continuums (beautiful/ugly, rich/poor, nice/mean, funny/serious, fun/boring, friend/foe, etc). The very nature of the idea of nondualism is utter nonsense to the human mind.

Nondualism implies, though, that the mind has another, simpler and purer function--which is to experience without judgement. Simply to be, to allow everything else to be, and to experience all this being.

True nondualism may be a tad extreme even for an open-minded, spiritually inclined individual though. It asks us to ignore ALL judgement--which at a certain point is dangerous and counterproductive. Nondualism is useful as a meditative idea, a way of experiencing the universe in its fullest, truest form as a single being, a single, unopposed power. So it's an idea to experience. But to live life as if there is no difference between good and evil, is ill advised and silly. To meditate that way though is quite useful. So we really don't need the mind to understand nondualism on a deep level, because it will reject it anyway. We only need the mind to imagine a state of nondualism, then meditate upon that state. Because for those who believe in the physical world as a dream state, which those spiritual traditions that gave rise to nondualistic philosophy do believe, nondualism is an idea about the true nature of reality more than the experience of the human illusion. Reality is non-dual, but our illusion is experienced much differently. The more we meditate on nondualism, the more we can see the reality behind the illusion, but this is all through experience in meditation, not cerebral understanding
